# Exploring TDD practices
An approach to explore the possibilities of test driven development techniques

## Getting started

First, initiate the configuration for the project setup:
```
python setup.py develop
```
Activate your venv and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# load project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run tests by doing:
```
pytest
```
